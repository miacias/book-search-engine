# Book Search Engine
MERN stack RESTful API using GraphQL API built with Apollo Server


## Description

Welcome to the Book Search Engine! This platform enables users to easily search for books through Google Books API. This is a quick way to see information like title, author(s), description, etcetera. Once a book has been identified, it can be saved to the user's profile with a simple click! 

The motivation behind refactoring this MERN stack project to include Apollo and GraphQL is to provide a unique user experience. By using GraphQL, it is possible to create a search engine that is both fast and responsive which contributes to a better user experience compared to traditional RESTful APIs where multiple requests may be required to retrieve all the necessary data. Incorporating GraphQL improves performance and allows for scalability by reducing the amount of data returned in each request and allowing for more efficient caching.

## Installation

N/A.  [Deployed site here!](https://obscure-woodland-88286.herokuapp.com/)


## Usage

To get started, consider creating an account. Then, search a book in the search bar to load the top 10 closest matches. If you'd like to save a book for later, select the "Save" button after the book's description. You can view your saved books by changing the page at the top of the screen. To remove any books from your profile, simply select "Delete." Log in sessions last for two hours, so you can let the timer time out, or you can click "Log Out."

## Roadmap

Content will be added and adjusted as new coding projects are available! Some projects may phase out over time as my work becomes more specialized. Some desired features and functionality to be added in the future:

- redesigned page view (colors, theme, etc.)
